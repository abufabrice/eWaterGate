PureWater Home RO System
Mineral Water from Your Tap – Saves Money, Boosts Health

Page 1: The Problem – Why Your Water Isn’t Safe or Affordable
1. Costly Bottled Water:

The average family in Yaoundé spends 15,000–30,000 XAF/month on bottled water.

Plastic waste clogs drains (Cameroon generates 600,000 tons of plastic waste annually).

2. Unreliable Tap Water:

Pipe-borne water often contains high TDS (300–500 ppm), bacteria, or heavy metals.

Boiling doesn’t remove chemical contaminants like nitrates or lead.

3. Hidden Health Risks:

Contaminated water causes diarrhea, kidney stones, and long-term diseases.

“1 in 5 Cameroonian children under 5 suffers from waterborne illnesses” (WHO, 2023).

2. Smart Mobile App:

Real-time monitoring of TDS, pH, turbidity, and filter health.

Alerts: “Your water is safe!” or “Replace Cartridge A in 7 days.”

3. Sustainable Design:

Saves 100+ kg of plastic/year per household.

Solar-compatible battery backup for power outages.
